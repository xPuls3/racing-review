# Wreckfest

Somewhat arcade handling.

Great handling for all lower class cars.  
Better tires are unavailable, making higher class hard to control.

Classes are determined by power to weight ratio.  
Collisions are a major part of races.

# Project Cars 2

Some cars can easily spin out or oversteer and require tuning, but it is managable with practice.  
AI racer performance is poor on wet tracks, meanwhile they seem to ignore puddles completely.

Runs just fine on the deck.

# Grand Turismo 4

Comes with a default controller deadzone that makes fine steering difficult.  
Use anti-deadzone to remove it, and the handling becomes great.

Car handling is less detailed, but still holds up today.
